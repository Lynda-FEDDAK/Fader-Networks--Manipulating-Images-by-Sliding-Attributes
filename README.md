# Fader Networks : Manipulating Images by Sliding Attributes

This repository showcases our machine learning project using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), inspired by [Fader Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00409) concept introduced by Guillaume Lample, Neil Zeghidour, Nicolas Usunier, Antoine Bordes, Ludovic Denoyer, and Marc'Aurelio Ranzato.

Fader Networks employ an encoder-decoder architecture to modify attributes of real images, such as gender, age, and the addition of eccesories like glasses. Throughout this process, the network preserves the intrinsic character of the image while generating diverse and realistic versions.
